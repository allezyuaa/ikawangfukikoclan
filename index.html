                Running through my mind
                The things I haven't told you (things I haven't told you)
                Now, I know I shouldn't lie
                But I'm too scared to show you
                
                Oh, don't you wanna know?
                Could get out of my hands when you lie in my bed
                Been tryna take it slow
                But I'm losing control and God only knows, that I
                
                Wish that I could be your lover
                Never met a girl like that
                I could treat you like no other
                Wanna be yours so bad
                Let me make you feel real
                Baby, we, maybe we'll make love all night
                Oh, oh, oh, wish that I could be your lover
                Wish that I could be your-, wish that I could-
                
                Funny that I find
                You don't wanna fight it (you don't wanna fight it)
                Baby, there's no need to be shy
                'Cause I can tell you like it
                
                Oh, don't you wanna know?
                Could get out of my hands when you lie in my bed
                Been tryna take it slow
                But I'm losing control and God only knows that I
                
                Wish that I could be your lover
                Never met a girl like that
                I could treat you like no other (no other)
                Wanna be yours so bad
                Let me make you feel real
                Baby, we, maybe we'll make love all night
                Oh, oh, oh, wish that I could be your lover (wish that I could be your-)
                Wish that I could be your-, wish that I could-
                
                Baby, I want, baby, I need it, I
                You got me all in my feelings, I
                I could be wrong (could be wrong)
                But baby, I mean it, I've held back for far too long (oh, whoa, whoa)
                
                You're my only
                Leave my body when you hold me
                So when we gonna?
                Baby, when you love me, when you, baby, can you? Oh
                
                Wish that I could be your lover
                Never met a girl like that
                I could treat you like no other (no other)
                Wanna be yours so bad
                Let me make you feel real
                Baby, we, maybe we'll make love all night
                Oh, oh, oh, wish that I could be your lover (wish that I could be your-)
                Wish that I could be your-, wish that I could-
